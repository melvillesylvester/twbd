<h1>GET INVOLVED</h1>
<h2>Men of Valor Mens Ministry</h2>
<p>The primary focus of the ministry is to encourage men in their Christian walk to live the victorious life to which God has called them.  The Ministry hosts monthly fellowships centered around the Word of God during which men are encouraged to share their life and current everyday challenges.  At the Men's Retreat, speakers are invited to share with the men regarding issues that specifically pertain to them.</p>
<h2>Daughters of Deborah Women's Ministry</h2>
<p>Like their namesake, this ministry helps its members to discover who they are in Christ and the talents and graces bestowed upon them by God.  Through monthly meetings and special ministry outreaches, the ministry seeks to promote the member's Christ-esteem, teach Godly principles related to their Proverbs 31 role and to nurture future leaders for the church and the larger community.</p>
<h2>Seniors Fellowship</h2>
<p>The Seniors Ministry provides a time of fellowship and the Word of God, welcoming men and women age 62 and above.  Men and women come together to celebrate the blessing of long life and God's provision.  The ministry reaches out to those who are home bound, follows-up with those seniors in nursing homes and monitors the health and other needs of our beloved family members.</p>

<h2>Single and Satisfied Fellowship</h2>
<p>The purpose of this ministry is to encourage single men and women of TWBD to celebrate their singleness and devote their time to living a holy lifestyle and sharing the love of Christ with others.  Through monthly social gatherings, guest speakers and other events, they learn who they are in Christ and how to be complete in Him</p>

<h2>Thy Will Be Done! Youth Fellowship</h2>
<p>The call of the Youth Ministry is to provide a loving, safe and fun environment where our youth can experience the unconditional love of Christ as He molds them to become future pastors, teachers, evangelists, missionaries and servants in His church.  The ministry does this by helping our youth find joy in the lord, live according to his Word, and be guided by His Spirit.  We accomplish this through Sunday school classes, youth retreats, praise dance ministry, and other Spirit-led outreaches.</p>
<h2>The Gazebo Nursery</h2>
<p>For infants and toddlers between the ages of 18 months through 5 years of age, this little slice of heaven introduces our blessings to Christ and his power at an early age.  The nursery is state-of-the-art with DVD players, CD players, crafts table and cubbies full of godly surprises.  The staff  utilizes a Christ centered curriculum and come prepared to instruct and nurture our future teachers, preachers and presidents.</p>
<h2>TWBD Praise Team </h2>
<p>The TWBD Praise Team lead men and women who serve the Lord through worship as an overflow of their love for a living Savior who first loved them.  Praise team leaders live set apart lives, knowing that they are responsible for leading the congregation into the presence of the Lord.  The Thy Will Be Done! Mass Choir lead worship on Sunday mornings. </p>


<h2>The Host and Hostesses Ministry</h2>
<p>"I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness" (Psalm 84:10).  As doorkeepers, members of this ministry have the awesome privilege of meeting and greeting the body of Christ as they enter into worship.  God uses them to minister to the hurting though prayer, a kind word or simply a warm smile.</p>
<h2>The Evangelism Ministry</h2>
<p>The Evangelism Ministry uses everyday opportunities to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with people. On the 4th of every month, they feed the disadvantaged and homeless of the community. They go into the city streets where the team speaks one on one with New Yorkers who are willing to listen, as well as give out Bibles, tapes and tracts. The team also visits a homeless shelter and a home for the mentally disabled. </p>
<h2>The Marriage Ministry</h2>
<p>The Marriage Ministry sponsors quarterly times of fellowship for the married couples of TWBD.  As the challenges for committed relationships grow every day, this ministry provides practical instruction based on biblical principles to strengthen these relationships made after the image of Christ and His Church.  The ministry also sponsors outings to plays and movies, casual dinners at the homes of our couples and the annual marriage retreat to a selected romantic resort.</p>

<h2>Crossroads Fellowship</h2>
<p>Crossroads young adults between the ages of 18-30 are chosen, called and anointed by God, to serve. We understand that being chosen is not easy but we boldly face trials depending on God, confessing His word and showing love along the way.  It’s a pleasure to serve the Lord!  Society doesn’t describe the Christian walk as “fun”, therefore we strive to set an example and show our peers the everlasting peace, joy and freedom that’s comes from living a righteous life. As a ministry, we strive to blaze like a torch, leading the lost and unsaved to Christ. We do so by submission, commitment and dedication. We focus on providing an inviting, youthful and fashionable environment where God can meet our needs.  We allow the light of Christ to shine through us.  Anointed young adults, chosen vessels determined to win souls for the Kingdom and bring glory to our father. </p>

<h2>Wednesday Prayer and Bible School</h2>
<p>TWBD's Corporate Prayer and School of the Bible combines praise and worship with prayer and gives members and friends an opportunity to study the Word of God line upon line, reaching for the deeper meanings and understandings of God and his plan for redemption.  The presenter provides opportunities to ask questions and seek specific direction in applying the principles of scripture to the personal lives of those who attend.  Wisdom must be applied to yield results. </p>
