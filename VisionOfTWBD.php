<h1>TWBD Vision</h1>
<p>Thy Will Be Done! Christian Ministries, otherwise known as TWBD, is a non-denominational fellowship founded on the uncompromising, infallible, unchanging Word of God.  Pastor Kevin, First Lady Sonya and the TWBD Family have determined to walk by faith, preach the truth of God's Word and His unconditional love.</p>
<p>The Three Pillars of the ministry are restoration, inspiration and manifestation.  We seek to restore the unsaved to a dynamic and intimate relationship with God through the preaching of the Gospel message that Jesus came to and did die for their sins.  In being restored, the born-again believer is inspired by Spirit-led ministries to seek first the Kingdom of God and God's plan and purpose for their lives.  And knowing the blue-print of their God-ordained destinies, TWBD encourages each member to realize that destiny.  Through the spoken and written Word, preaching of the revealed knowledge of God and hands-on ministry, each member will manifest God's perfect will for their lives, revolutionizing their families, jobs, communities and even the nations of the world.</p>
<p>Sitting in the middle of Spanish Harlem, which is located in the heart of New York City, TWBD is a multi-cultural ministry that does not remain behind the walls of the church building but reaches into and effects positive change in the harvest of souls that is New York City.  Each member of the TWBD Family serves as a conduit of God's love, grace and mercy.  We feed the hungry, water the spirits of the thirsty and provide hope to the dying of New York City, believing God for the miraculous.</p>
<p>TWBD desires for you to live in victory as you mature in faith.  As you come to understand the length, width, height and depth of God's love, you will soon realize that nothing is impossible for you to accomplish in His Name and by faith in God's promises.  Life will become what it was always meant to be: a wondrous and exciting ADVENTURE with God ordering your STEPS.</p>
<p>WE LOVE YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOU SEEING YOU SOON!!</p>
