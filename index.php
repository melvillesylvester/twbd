<p>Your interest in partnership is evidence of the fact that not only has this ministry affected your life, but you also have a desire to help someone else and believe this message can provide that help. Together, through partnership, you and I can reach more people than we could by laboring alone.<br/>

<h1>WELCOME! WELCOME! WELCOME!</h1>
<p><img src="/images/Photo1164a.jpg" border="0" class="image_left image_b7">As Pastor and First Lady of Thy Will Be Done! Christian Ministries ("TWBD"), we greet you in the matchless name of Jesus Christ.  Thank you for joining us and the TWBD family on the World-Wide Web.  It is our hope that our Website will be a valuable tool in bringing you closer to the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We purpose in God to be a church designed for those looking for the real thing!  Let's face it.  Many people are not involved in church these days.  Too often...<br/>
* the sermons are boring and don't relate to daily living<br/>
* many churches seem more interested in your wallet than you<br/>
* members are unfriendly to visitors<br/>
* you never see the church giving to the needy of our community.<br/>
</p>
<br/><br/><br />
<h2>TWBD is DIFFERENT!</h2>
<p>We are a supportive family that strives to live the true Christian life.  Our Sunday and Wednesday services are filled with praise to your God that still saves, delivers, heals and prospers His people!  Hallelujah!  TWBD sponsors numerous outreaches to the Spanish Harlem and greater New York City communities.  We feed and clothe the poor, provide sound and exciting Bible instruction, and restore hope to those of our communities who have abandoned their belief and trust in God.</p>
<p>In the service of the King,<br/>
<br/>Pastor Kevin and First Lady Sonya McClanahan</p>

<h1>Our Church News</h1>
<p>The Gospel of Jesus Christ is good news.  We believe that every man, woman and child are born in sin and need a savior.  Without God's intervention, life is without purpose and filled with insurmountable challenges.  Yet, our message is one of victory.  By establishing a relationship with Jesus Christ, you can be born anew, have all of your past failures forgiven and walk in God's power that will catapult you to a victorious life.  TWBD is a cathedral of hope, declaring that GOD IS GOOD and REWARDS those who diligent seek to obey and please Him.</p>
<p>If you're tired of fighting the good fight of faith alone, please consider joining our family.  We would be truly honored to contribute to your spiritual growth in the Lord!</p>

<h1>Pastor's Pen</h1>
<p>I have always wondered about the idea of “God’s Will.”  Some Christians believe that everything happens within God’s will or is allowed by God to ensure that God’s will is done.  The first belief system holds that God causes each event in our lives–good or bad.  The other acknowledges that God does not cause everything to happen but may ALLOW other agents to create circumstances that will promote God’s will–even if these circumstances are tragic and against the revealed CHARACTER of God.<br/>
